# Trapping-Rainwater-leetcode-problem.

The Trapping Rainwater problem involves finding the maximum amount of water that can be trapped between non-negative integer heights, where each height represents an elevation. The solution calculates the trapped water by considering the minimum of the maximum heights on both sides of each bar minus the bar's own height.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
